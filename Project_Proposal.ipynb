    "\n",
    "There are a variety of challenges present in the dataset, specifically within the attributes of _Quartile Range_, _Time Period Label_, _Time Period Start/End Date_ attributes, and the _Phase_ attribute.  In the _Quartile Range_ attribute, not all of the instances have values in the dataset.  The attributes of _Time Period Label_, _Time Period Start Date_, and _Time Period End Date_ may require additional libraries to interpret the \"Month Day - Month Day\" and the time and date stamp formats of the instances.  The last potential challenge of this dataset is the _Phase_ attribute because there seems to be some incomplete entries for some of the instances due to ongoing phases, marked by a \"-1\". We will likely remove these from the dataset because there aren't very many of them so we can focus on the finished phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many attributes present in the dataset, but there are also a few ways we can pare down the attributes without taking away from the integrity of the data. Many of the attributes in the dataset are very similar to or related to other attributes. For example, the attribute _Low CI_ and _High CI_ indicate the lowest and highest confidence intervals for each instance. The attribute right after _High CI_ is the _Confidence Interval_ has the format \"_Low CI_ - _High CI_\". We can condence the dataset by simply omitting the _Low CI_ and _High CI_ attributes since we have those values within the _Confidence Interval_, or vice versa. We could even calculate the margin of error from the _CI_ and _Value_ and use that instead of any of the _CI_ values, if we wanted to. Likewise, the _Time Period Start/End Date_ attributes and the _Time Period Label_ attribute can also be condensed by omitting the _Time Period Start/End Date_ attributes and only using the _Time Period Label_, or vice versa. We will also likely use either _Phase_ or _Time Period_, since both of these describe the period in which the data is being collected. _Time Period_ is simply more specific."

    "## Impact of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we have chosen can be analyzed to show any potential changes in healthcare accessability during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how socioeconomic backgrounds (education, race, age, ethnicity, sex, etc.) and location (by state within the United States) may affect whether or not an individual will be able to access healthcare under current conditions. Using these results, we may be able to target specific demographics that have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19 for assistance from government or aid group efforts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders in this data are: people who are marginalized (people of color, elderly, people with little to no education background), policy makers, healthcare workers, essential workers, as well as people who are privileged in our society. Essentially, anyone who has been affected by COVID-19 and/or is involved in health care (whether as a patient or a provider), is a stakeholder in the results of this dataset. The patients because they are the ones who are having delayed medical access, and the providers because who they are treating successfully is important information to pay attention to."
